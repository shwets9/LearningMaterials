Auto Scaling
=====================================
Two parts:
	i) Launch Configuration
	ii) Auto Scaling Group

3 Type:
	i) Manual
	ii) Policy Based (also called Dynamic)
	iii) Scheduled Based - It is recurring

1. Only one launch configuration can be attached with autoscaling group.
2. Auto Scaling cooldown time, during this time no auto scaling activity is taking place.
3. Auto scaling should not happen frequently. 
4. Once the launch configuration is created it cannot be modified, you need to copy it and then change.
5. Lifecycle Hooks - Its basically a script which 
6. When you are combining autoscaling with ELB healthcheck should be ELB rather than EC2.

Default Termination Policy
---------------------------------------
1. Terminate from availability zone that has more instances.
2. If same no. of instances then terminate the instance having oldest launch configuration.
3. If same launch configuration as well then terminate the instance nearest to the billing hour.
